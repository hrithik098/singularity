# Singularity
A exploration towards writing code for microcontrollers in any language. Not just in C/C++.

## Objective
The objective of the project is analyze whether it is possible to build a program that allows us to write programs for embedded microcontrollers in any lanugage? Such that the code is also portable, so that we are able to run it from one platform to the other.

What do we require:
 - Supports **multiple programming languages**
 - Supports **multiple microcontroller architecture**
 - Support for code compatibility across different microcontrollers i.e. **code portability**
 - Optimized **production ready code**.
